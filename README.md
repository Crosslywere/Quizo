# Quizo

Spring boot configuration can be gotten [here](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.3.4&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=21&groupId=com.quizo&artifactId=app&name=quizo&description=Quizzing%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.crossly.quizo&dependencies=lombok,devtools,web,vaadin,data-jpa,postgresql,security)

## Plans for the Software (Features to implement)

1. There should be two login tabs; for creators/admins and another for quiz players.
2. Quiz players don't have to always come in through a link, they should be able to use the title of the exam and the nickname of its creator to log into a quiz.
3. Creators should be notified when someone who has logged in before is trying to log in again (when reentry is not allowed).
